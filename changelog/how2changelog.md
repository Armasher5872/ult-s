# How to make a character data doc
1. Make sure you have a downloaded copy of the vanilla scripts from wuboy's repository (smashline)
2. run py statistics.py {char_name} and follow all prompts
3. run py stats2md.py
4. open output.md, edit it to where its accurate and makes sense (some specials need more editing than others, all projectiles need their info put into the move, projectile stats are on the bottom)
5. save as {character}.md within the changelog

# How to update a character data doc (for your PRs)
1. do same as above except instead of replacing the entirety of the character's .md file, only the moves changed within your PR
